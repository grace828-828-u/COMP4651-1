# DataFrame Live Programming

The code is adapted from Sameer Farooqui's hands-on tutorial in [Spark SF Meetup 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K14plpZgy_c&t=1083s) using [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/).  

Notebooks were run on [Databricks](https://community.cloud.databricks.com) community edition cluster. `Fire Incidents Exploration - Runme.ipynb` is the main notebook used for the session, while `datasets_mount.ipynb` is used to load the required data.

For ease of use, upload `SFmeetup.dbc`, installed from [here](https://bit.ly/sfopenlabs), directly to databricks to uplaod all necessary files and codes at once.
